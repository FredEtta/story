In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God 
For God so loved the world that he sent his only begotton son that who so ever belive in him will not perish but have everlasting life Amen 
i am the hard maed of the love let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our tresspassed as we forgive those who tresspas against us lead us not into temptation but deliver us fom evil
